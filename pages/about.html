<h3> I'm Nic Lane (he/him), a pākehā New Zealander, who grew up in Taupō-nui-a-Tia on Ngāti Tūwharetoa whenua, before moving to Te Whanganui-a-tara in 1993. I am tangata tiriti and I recognise that without Te Tiriti o Waitangi I wouldn't have the right to inhabit this whenua.
  I acknowledge that I currently stand on land that was never ceded, and that Te Āti Awa, Ngāti Toa Rangatira, Ngāti Raukawa are tangata whenua.

My parents Janet, and Joseph arrived to Taupō (via Perth) in 1979, but both whakapapa to Ottawa, Canada. Since arriving they had three boys, of which I'm the youngest.

<h2>
  I believe in building an equitable future where barriers and biases are better understood. Where inclusion is created through culturally sound and person-centred approaches, resulting in better serving our communities.
