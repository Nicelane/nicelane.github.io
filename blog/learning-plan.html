    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <h3></h3>

    <h2>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h2>

    <h2>
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Previosuly I've prioritised others before myself, and am currently
      attempting to put myself first more of the time. I'm keen to practise more
      leadership skills as well as looking at how as a collectively we actively
      share this between ourselves. I'm currently working on how I better
      express emotions, and manage regulating these. Recently I've found the app
      'How We Feel' really good for regularly inputing information and being
      able to look back for more insights. Having productive hard conversations
      is also something I'm keen to put more care into, sometimes I can come
      across as quite critical and I want people to feel like I'm sharing more
      from a place of care, love, and improvement rather than attacking.

          I'm commited to taking it easy on myself, having come from a place of
          under-resourced burnout I know what it feels like to run on empty. I
          want to ensure when I turn up that I'm present and commited to the
          wider group. When I'm wound up my default trauma responses are normaly
          flight or fawn, and that I need to actively communicate this to the
          person/people on the other side, incase not solving in the moment is
          going to aggravate them up further. Sometimes what's best for me is to
          go for a walk, jump on my bike, do some quiet journaling or phone a
          friend. I currently do supervision/counselling once a week, but
          generally I feel like I get more insight from people who understand me
          a little bit deeper.

    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    <p>
      I will flag any conflicts or concerns to group facilitators, to ensure I'm
      not burdening myself with other peoples things. I will find out how to
      access the support identified within the booklet. I will build trust and
      comfort with others so that I am approachable if they need something.
    </p>

    <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding that I know what's best for my learning, and I need to be
      supported to lead it. When I identify needs and required resourced that
      they are followed through with or a discussion of alternative options is
      undertaken. Valuing of my time and the skills that I bring.

    other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school
