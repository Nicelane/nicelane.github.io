    <h1>Identify Values</h1>
    <h2>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

    <p> I'm aroreretini (but have yet to lean into the medical system to gain an official diagnoses) with it comes a strong moral compass, and insane level of rightenous. </p>
    <p> Having worked in the arts often artists are just happy doing what they love without monetary value. Sometimes this comes with certain conditioning that they should just be happy getting what they're given. Like many people within society often they can't be bothered by the small print of contracts and agreements, and just want to get on with things. This can especially be the case when these documents are written in legalese. </p>
    <p> When when of the artists I work with received funding from the NZ Arts Council, they put additional conditions on it. We responding with our own conditions, including having the contract in an official format known as Easy Read. After two years of Human Rights Proceedings we ending up paving the way for plain language contracts and new policy for disabled artists to gain sovereighnty within arts funding in Aotearoa. </p>
    <p> Reflecting on the decision, many of our peers at the time suggested taking the money and just getting on with it. I believe our self sacrifice helped shift the funding culture for those behind us, but it came at a financial and emotional toll that shouldn't have been there in the first place if international law was followed. </p>

    <h2>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h2>
    <p>I've been priviledged to grow up in Aotearoa, and benefit from living on the shores of Te Moana Nui a Kiwa. 
      <p>Raised by white Canadian immigrants they gave me a foundation of holding to and advocating for principles that I believe in. Both my parents have a strong sense of hustle, and while my mum doesn't appreciate me saying it, I was raised in the strong north american tradiional of capitalism.</p>
      <p>Feminism has always been present in my life, but my parents shied away from outwardly identifying themselves as such, in my earlier life my mum did a lot more of the parenting, but as I turned into a teenager she shifted into more of a breadwinner role and my father got to take up house husband status.</p>
      <p>As I've grown older I've gravitated more towards working with and including Samoan, MƒÅori, POC, and disabled artists into my chosen family. This contributed so much to my sense of identity and where I place myself in the world.</p>
      <p>More deeply I've had partners who regularly challenge my thinking, and I actively attempt to become more aware of my privlege, biases, and continue to be enlightened.</p>

    <h2>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
      <p>When focused I can be a non-stop workhorse. I love problem solving and coming up with different, unique and innovative solutions. Working in group is super enjoyable as well as attempting to enable everybody to feel like they can share their point of view.   
      </p>

    <h2>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      <p>Having worked in a self driven space, often on projects that I'm super passionate about, one of my fears is when work isn't that exciting questioning how much I want to lean into it. As a producer I've often been in the 'nobody else wants to do it' gap-filler type roles, this has pushed me into a more generalised skill set. At the moment I'm keen to lean into more hard and specialised skills, which would help to round out everything else I bring to the table.</p>
      <p>Balancing time is probably my biggest limitation, as a people pleaser and person who often leans into community, I can often sacrifice myself by saying yes to too many things, ensuring I'm prioritising myself will probably be the hardest thing.</p>
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
      <p>As I've gotten older I'm more into leaning into the auntie approach to dealing with struggles, talking through things to get the the heart of the issue, and attmepting to adjust, and remove pain points. Where parties can't voice or hear the other person, sometimes mediation helps. In the past when leading projects, I've had to suck up my own feelings and get on with it, honesty is my prefered route but when the other party isn't seeing the same truth sometimes having supervision or counselling to talk through and validate or breakdown an individual perspective is helpful.
