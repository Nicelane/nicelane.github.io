    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is the understanding and skillset of managing ones
      own and those around you emotions in a positive way. It helps individuals
      emotionally regulate, or how they respond in a timely, healthy and
      appropriate way. It leads to better communication, ability to empathise,
      and resolve conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marc Brackett uses the RULER acronym to define the five skills of
      emotional intelligence (Recognizing, Understanding, Labeling, Expressing,
      and Regulating)
    </p>

    <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
    <p>
      IQ is our logic based cognitive ability, whereas EQ is our emotional
      understanding and response to those around us. EQ can help us respond
      under stress, navigate social interactions, and make thoughtful decisions,
      rather than just passing a test.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
    <p>
      Because life is inherently social, with community and social structures
      needing group dynamics to work in some kind of harmony. Previously in the
      industrialised labour market it hasn't been valued, as there wasn't a
      perception of value add. In the modern environment we acknowledge
      ourselves not just as labour units/machines and that there is complex
      environments around us that affect how we behave. There seems to have been
      gender biases about who defaultly cares and handles this labour
      traditionally. As more people are empowered to have a better understanding
      of themselves, our communities and workplaces will prosper and begin to
      heal.
